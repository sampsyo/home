I do programming languages and computer architecture.
I like research that breaks down abstraction barriers and rethinks the hardware--software interface.
I worked on [*approximate computing*][approx], the idea that computers can be more efficient if we let them make mistakes.
See what's going on in [my research group][capra], which is called *Capra*.
