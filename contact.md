Here are some answers to common questions.


### Can you send me the slides for a talk you gave?  {#slides}

There are links to my talks in my [conference paper list][confpapers]. There are PDF versions there, and I can also send you Keynote files if you [email me][email]. I don't have PowerPoint files.

If you're presenting a paper in a reading group, I'd love to hear a summary of the discussion!


### I'm a Cornell undergraduate, and I'm curious about getting involved in research.  {#ugresearch}

Yay! Please check out my research group's [instructions for prospective undergraduate researchers][capra-ugr]. We really enjoy collaborating with talented Cornell undergrads.


### I'm one of your undergraduate advisees. Can you meet up so I can ask you some questions or get a form signed?  {#advising}

I'd be happy to! Please [pick a time][advmtg].

Before you do, though, I should warn you that if your question is about course requirements, graduation logistics, and the like, I'm not the best person to ask---our [undergraduate advisors][ugrad] are the true experts. You can reach them in Gates 110 or at [ugrad@cs.cornell.edu](mailto:ugrad@cs.cornell.edu).

### I'm applying to grad school soon, and I'm interested in doing research with you!  {#grad}

Fantastic! I'm thrilled that you're interested in the same kinds of hardware--software abstraction problems that I am. Cornell is a great place to do a Ph.D. in computer science.

Please [apply to the Ph.D. program at Cornell CS][csapply] or [in ECE][eceapply]. I'll look forward to reading your application to either department.

We have a department-wide collective admissions process, which means that I can't say anything useful about your chances for acceptance.
Our programs are very competitive, however, so be sure to apply to multiple programs.


### I'm looking for a summer research internship.  {#intern}

I can't consider internship applications from non-Cornell students right now. (That includes "self-funded" applicants.) I hope you find a great internship with another group!

However, I am interested in working undergraduates from underrepresented groups via the [DREU][] and [LSAMP][] programs. Please consider applying to one of those if you are eligible.


### May we "repost" the text of one of your blog posts on our site?  {#repost}

I'm glad you're interested in the article! But copies of blog posts on sites I don't control make it impossible for me to correct mistakes or add updates in the future. Please don't "repost" anything.
