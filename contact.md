Here are some answers to common questions.


### Can you send me the slides for a talk you gave?  {#slides}

There are links to my talks in my [conference paper list][confpapers]. There are PDF versions there, and I can also send you Keynote files if you [email me][email]. I don't have PowerPoint files.

If you're presenting a paper in a reading group, I'd love to hear a summary of the discussion!


### I'm a Cornell undergraduate, and I'm curious about getting involved in research.  {#ugresearch}

Yay! Please check out my research group's [instructions for prospective undergraduate researchers][capra-ugr]. We really enjoy collaborating with talented Cornell undergrads.


### I'm one of your undergraduate advisees. Can you meet up so I can ask you some questions or get a form signed?  {#advising}

I'd be happy to! Please [pick a time][advmtg].
Please send any forms along before you schedule the meeting.

Before you do, though, I should warn you that if your question is about course requirements, graduation logistics, and the like, I'm not the best person to ask---our [undergraduate advisors][ugrad] are the true experts. For example, that office signs part 2 of the [A&S application to graduate][graduation] (this policy supersedes the college's advice that your faculty advisor should sign it). You can reach them in Rhodes 516/518 or at [ugrad@cs.cornell.edu](mailto:ugrad@cs.cornell.edu).

### Can I enroll in a class you're teaching, even though it appears to be full?  {#enroll}

Please see the CS department's [guidance and FAQs about course enrollment][csenroll].
I do not control waitlists, nor do I have the ability to distribute PINs---for that, please contact the email alias on that page.

### I'm applying to grad school soon, and I'm interested in doing research with you!  {#grad}

This year (the 2025 application cycle), I am not looking for new PhD students.
However, we have extremely strong PL and architecture groups at Cornell; I strongly encourage you to apply to work with other advisors we have here.
Please [apply to the Ph.D. program at Cornell CS][csapply] or [in ECE][eceapply].

<!--
Fantastic! I'm thrilled that you're interested in the same kinds of hardware--software abstraction problems that I am. Cornell is a great place to do a Ph.D. in computer science.

Please [apply to the Ph.D. program at Cornell CS][csapply] or [in ECE][eceapply]. I'll look forward to reading your application to either department.

We have a department-wide collective admissions process, which means that I can't say anything useful about your chances for acceptance.
Our programs are very competitive, however, so be sure to apply to multiple schools.
-->


### I'm looking for a summer research internship.  {#intern}

I can't consider internship applications from non-Cornell students right now. (That includes "self-funded" applicants.) I hope you find a great internship with another group!

However, I am interested in working undergraduates from underrepresented groups via the [DREU][] and [LSAMP][] programs. Please consider applying to one of those if you are eligible.


### May we "repost" the text of one of your blog posts on our site?  {#repost}

I'm glad you're interested in the article! But copies of blog posts on sites I don't control make it impossible for me to correct mistakes or add updates in the future. Please don't "repost" anything.


### I'm an undergrad at Cornell. Can (or should) I take CS 6120?  {#ug6120}

[CS 6120][] is a PhD-level course, but it is common for undergrads to take it.
*Please only do so if you are really excited about compilers.*
In my experience, students who are specifically interested in compilers in particular have a great time; for students who are just looking for some elective to take, it is a waste of time.
If you are more interested in getting lots of programming experience, there are 4xxx courses that would be a better fit.

You should also be aware that, like most PhD-level courses, CS 6120 is less structured than your typical undergrad course.
There are fewer deadlines and more flexibility on all the coursework.
That's part of the reason I think it's only worth your time if you're actually motivated.

It is not required to take our undergrad compilers course, [CS 4120][], as a prerequisite.
I *recommend* taking it first because it can help you decide whether you like compilers.
But the course is designed for PhD students who come to Cornell without having taken a compilers course in undergrad, so it does not directly depend on the 4120 content.
(In fact, prior students have reported that the first part of 6120 can feel like a review of 4120 material.)


### Can you send me your bio, photo, and CV?  {#bio}

Here's a [short bio and photo][bio], and here's my [CV][].
